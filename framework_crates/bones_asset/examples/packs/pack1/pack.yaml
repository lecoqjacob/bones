#
# This is an example asset pack.
#

# Each pack has a name, meant to be a user display name.
name: Pack 1

# Each pack has a version. Packs will use semver to match dependencies between packs.
version: 0.1.0

# The pack must also specify the game version that it is compatible with. This uses
# cargo's version parsing conventions.
#
#   Note: In the tutorial example we set the game version to 0.1.3. That is compatible
#   with version 0.1.0, so this asset pack will load, even though there is not an exact
#   version match.
game_version: 0.1.0

# Each pack has a unique ID, which is made up of a string prefix, an underscore, and a ULID
# identifier.
id: pack-1_01H4PKNEVFFW3TH09R1N8006BA

# Finally, we specify the root asset for the pack.
root: ./pack1.plugin.yaml
